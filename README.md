 Simple-GUI-Java-Calculator is a java program for a simple calculator that enables the user to perform the basic arithmetic operations like addition,subtraction,division and multiplication.
 The output of the operation performed is displayed on a textfield .
 The calculator also has a clear button to allow the user to clear the textfield and perfom the next operation.
 The buttons are visually stunning which I made possible by utilizing the javax.swing and the java.awt packages tools.
